My dotfiles specific castle for Linux üíª  ‚Äìmanaged by
[Homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

To understand more, visit my [main dotfiles repo](https://github.com/gerardbosch/dotfiles).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Files out of `home`, like the ones in `etc` are not symlinked by Homeshick! They are
  system-wide settings and need to be symlinked manually (probably with sudo).
